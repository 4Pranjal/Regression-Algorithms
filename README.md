# Regression Algorithms Exploration on California Housing Dataset

This repository contains Python code that explores and compares different regression algorithms using the California Housing dataset. The primary goal is to predict housing prices based on various features present in the dataset. The code includes the implementation of Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression algorithms, along with visualization and evaluation.

## Getting Started

To run the code on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/4Pranjal/Regression-Algorithms.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. You can create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd Regression-Algorithms
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook to explore the code and results:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Regression_Algorithms_Exploration.ipynb
   ```

## Contents

- `Regression_Algorithms_Exploration.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for exploring and comparing regression algorithms.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Dataset

The California Housing dataset is used for this exploration. It contains various features related to housing in California, including median income, housing median age, average rooms, etc.

## Algorithms Explored

1. **Linear Regression:**
   - Standard Linear Regression model training and evaluation.
   - Cross-validation and negative mean squared error (MSE) scores.
   - Prediction visualization using distribution plot.
   - R-squared score calculation for evaluation.

2. **Ridge Regression:**
   - Ridge Regression model training and evaluation.
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
   - Best parameters and scores printed.
   - Prediction visualization using distribution plot.
   - R-squared score calculation.

3. **Lasso Regression:**
   - Lasso Regression model training and evaluation.
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
   - Best parameters and scores printed.
   - Prediction visualization using distribution plot.

## Results

The code provides insights into the performance of Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression algorithms on predicting housing prices. Visualization of predictions and residuals aids in understanding the predictive capabilities of these algorithms.
